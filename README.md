# Chat App
## The Aim of the App
  This app aims to allow people to chat with each other from anywhere in the world easily and intuitively, from one app.

## Current functionality
* ### Register page:
  You can register to the website. Registration requires a username, password, a display name and a profile picture.
  
  Currently, the register page doesn't save your login credentials, and it is just cosmetic, to show the layout of the site
  when future functionality is added.
  
  If you've already registered, you can click on the bottom of the page to go to the login page.
    
* ### Login page:
  On this page you can login to the website using the credentials you've provided in the registration form.
  
  Currently the login button on the page doesn't send you to the chat page, since there is no mechanism (currently)
  to check the credentials and whether they match a user that has registered in the past.
  
  If you haven't logged in yet, you can click on the bottom of the page to go the register page.
    
* ### Chat page:
  This is the main page of the app. On the left you can see your display name and your profile picture at the top,
  along with a button to add new chats to your chat list, which you can see right underneath.
  
  The chat list contains the list of all the chats that you have added in the past. Every chat is identified in the list
  with a profile picture, a display name, and the last message sent or recieved, with its date.
  
  From the chat list you can select a chat to display on the right side. If a chat is selected, it will be highlighted
  in blue.
  
  On the right side you can see the selected chat. At the top you have the other person's profile picture and display
  name. Below that you have the chat itself containing all the messages, and below that you have the message box along
  with a send button.
  
  Currently the chat page has no functionality, meaning you can't select a different chat than the one already selected,
  you can't add new chats, and you can't send or recieve any messages.
